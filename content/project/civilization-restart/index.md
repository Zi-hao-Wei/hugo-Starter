This is the final project for VG100 in UM-SJTU JI. We learn the functional programming language ELM from the scratch and use ELM to implement this game. In this game, you are the last hope of humans and are destined to save the world dominated by AI monsters. In the game, you can choose various weapons and skill trees. Apart from the game itself, we also write the background story, docs, a poster, and made a trailer.

This project won **the highest score** among all games in the summer exhibition of 2020 in JI.
